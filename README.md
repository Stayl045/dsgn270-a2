## Part 2: Call-to-Action Critique ##

### **Call-To-Action-Critique** ###
![CalltoActionImage](https://github.com/Stayl045/dsgn270-a2/blob/b81782a395a4a04852f6c39a220d6bfbd5159065/Harry%20Rosen%20call%20to%20action.png)

On the onset, Harry Rosen’s call-to-action is clearly the biggest image on the page that they’re drawing users attention towards. That would be their “winter sale, up to 50% off”, which includes a big “shop now” button. This seems to establish a strong visual hierarchy that is pleasing to the eye. This effect is accomplished by the scale of the image being larger than the others. In addition, the bold red on the image contrasts the white of the button/font and negative space around the font and image itself again draws the eye to the call-to-action. Furthermore, the typography used conveys their target audience (wealthy/older). 

**For example:**
-	The font that is used may seem simple in nature, however, it connects to the target audience.
-	The font are easy read and contrasts with the background nicely. 
-	The font of “up to 50% off” is the largest of the surrounding fonts. Again, the intended effect is to draw the users eye to that.
-	The designer specifically choose a red background over an image of clothing to let the users curiosity click the “shop now” button.
